# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I think I have made good estimates of how long tasks will take me so far.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

I'd use the recipe analogy.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Parameters are placeholders within the original function declaration for the arguments that come when the function is actually called.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I still don't quite understand recursive functions so I'd like to learn that.
